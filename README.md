## About the project
Our project is intended for car company owners to facilitate and organize their car related details and documents. It consists of two applications, the control panel (admin application) and the user application (car company owners).

The first application is only for the administration use, and it contains 6 HTML pages that provides the ability for the admin to add car brands, models, and car's document types. It also allows the admin to add, edit, and delete showrooms for companies owners.

The second application is intended for the car companies owners, where each company will have their own showroom that allows them to change the showroom password that was created by the admin for security. It also provides them with the ability to add cars to their showrooms, edit the car's details whenever there is ubdates. and display all information and documents for each car.

The fron end of the the application is done by using Bootstrap and CSS. It contains 12 HTML pages in total, and the styling of the project is minimal and user-friendly. Moreover, AJAX was used to communicate with the backend, especially with the showroom dashboard live search functionality, and dynamic dependent dropdown select box in adding and editing car information page.

In regards to the back end, it is done by using python language (Django framework). MTV pattern was used to link the Admin model class with the showroom model with one to many relationship, and linking the showroom model with the car model in one to many relationship. Moreover, the linking relationship between the car model, brandModel model, and the document model is one to many relationship. Validations were added for admin login, showroom login, showroom add and edit forms, and car add and edit froms.

## Templates of the first application

  you need to initialize a new admin instance by using the pyhton shell, also don't forget to apply migrations:

>>> import bcrypt

>>> hashed_pw=bcrypt.hashpw('QWER1234'.encode(), bcrypt.gensalt()).decode()

>>> Admin.objects.create(first_name='Admin',last_name='Admin',email='Admin@Admin.com',password=hashed_pw)
